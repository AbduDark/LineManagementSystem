- A workflow validates the code compiles successfully
- `dotnet build` runs successfully with EnableWindowsTargeting flag

### On Windows (Actual Execution)
1. Install .NET 8.0 SDK or Runtime
2. Clone/download the project
3. Run: `dotnet restore && dotnet build && dotnet run`
4. Application will launch with WPF UI

## Known Limitations
- Windows-only (WPF dependency)
- Cannot run on Replit or any Linux/Mac environment
- Requires Windows 10 or newer
- Barcode scanner (XB-2055) only works on Windows with proper drivers
